The transition from a traditional banking environment to a global investment bank like Nomura is more than just a change in title—it is a shift in how one views the lifecycle and velocity of financial data. 

My journey began with over a decade at **Indian Overseas Bank (IOB)**, where I focused on the technical orchestration of credit and performance systems. Today, that foundation supports my work as a **Data Engineer cum Software Engineer**, building high-performance pipelines and open-source financial utilities.

## The Foundation: 10 Years of Engineering at IOB
While many see banking through the lens of operations, I approached it as a massive, multi-dimensional data problem. My primary objective was to transform granular, branch-level data into high-velocity insights for two distinct audiences: Executive Leadership (Strategic) and Branch Managers (Tactical).

### 1. Multi-Period Performance Analytics Ecosystem
I architected a comprehensive monitoring system designed to track health across the entire bank hierarchy. The core of this system was a sophisticated data engine capable of automated **Target-vs-Actual gap analysis**. 

To provide a 360-degree view of growth and volatility, I engineered pipelines to handle complex time-series aggregations, providing visibility across:
* **Day-over-Day (DoD):** Monitoring immediate business daily fluctuations.
* **Month-over-Month (MoM):** Identifying short-term growth trends and seasonal shifts.
* **Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ):** Aligning performance with fiscal reporting cycles.
* **Annual-over-Annual (YoY):** Assessing long-term trajectory and structural growth.



### 2. Credit Analytics & Underwriting Pipelines
Beyond performance tracking, I specialized in the technical orchestration of **MSME and Retail Credit** workflows. This involved:
* **Digital Underwriting:** Translating legacy credit policies into automated, logic-driven decision engines.
* **Risk Pipelines:** Aggregating disparate data points into streamlined workflows to evaluate creditworthiness for retail portfolios and small businesses.

## The Pivot: Macquarie and Nomura
In late 2024, my career moved into the global investment banking space. After serving at **Macquarie**, I transitioned to **Nomura** following their acquisition of the business. 

In this high-stakes environment, the focus shifted toward high-frequency data and extreme reliability. My current role involves:
* Orchestrating high-scale financial data pipelines using **Airflow**.
* Managing containerized environments with **Docker**.
* Ensuring data integrity and performance using **Java, Python, and PostgreSQL**.

## Bridging the Gap: Open Source Contributions
To contribute back to the fintech community, I maintain two key libraries on PyPI that reflect my focus on data reliability and financial logic:

* **[AtomSql](https://pypi.org/project/atomsql/):** A lightweight Python ORM designed for clean and efficient database interactions, built with financial application performance in mind.
* **[qfinbox](https://pypi.org/project/qfinbox/):** A specialized fintech library focused on quantitative analysis and streamlining financial data workflows.

## Looking Ahead
My goal for 2026 is to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible at the intersection of systems engineering and finance. I am currently focusing on:
* **AWS Certifications:** Deepening my expertise in **Data Engineering** and **Machine Learning** on the cloud.
* **Systems Languages:** Mastering **Go** and **Rust** to build the next generation of high-performance financial architecture.
