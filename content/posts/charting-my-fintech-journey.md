## Welcome to singhprashant.in! 🎉

After more than a decade immersed in the fast-evolving world of financial technology, I’m excited to open this space where I can share lessons learned, industry insights, and the projects that keep me curious.

From the granular details of credit scorecards to the high-level architecture of asset management systems, my career has been a journey of bridging the gap between raw data and financial decisions. This blog is my way of giving back to the community that helped me grow.
