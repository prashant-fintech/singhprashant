## Open Source Contributions

I maintain and contribute to projects on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), the Python Package Index, making tools and libraries available to the broader Python community.

### My PyPI Projects

**[atomsql](https://pypi.org/project/atomsql/)** - A lightweight Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that simplifies database interactions with an intuitive API. Designed for developers who need efficient database operations without the complexity of heavier ORMs.

**[qfinbox](https://pypi.org/project/qfinbox/)** - A financial analytics and quantitative finance library providing tools for risk calculations, portfolio analysis, and financial modeling. Built to support financial professionals and data engineers working with financial data.

## Professional Interests

My primary focus area is **Financial Risk Management**, where I combine my technical expertise with domain knowledge to build robust risk assessment and monitoring systems. I'm particularly interested in:

- Architecting and developing 360° Financial Risk Platforms using modern cloud technologies
- Credit risk modeling and analytics
- Risk data aggregation and reporting
- Real-time risk monitoring systems
- Regulatory compliance technology
